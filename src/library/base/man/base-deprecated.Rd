\description{
  These functions are provided for compatibility with older versions of
  \R only, and may be defunct as soon as the next release.

%% for example 'SpotfireÂ® Enterprise Runtime for R' aka TERR or 'pqR'
  \code{is.R} tests if it is not running under historical dialects of S
  (including S-PLUS), but cannot exclude other (including future)
  programs claiming compatibility with \R.  Its historical definition
  was
\preformatted{
  exists("version") && !is.null(vl <- version$language) && vl == "R"
}
  which always evaluates to \code{TRUE} in \R.
}
\usage{
is.R()
}

  Deprecated
  functions in standard packages other than the base package are listed in
  \code{help("pkg-deprecated")}, where \samp{pkg} is replaced by the
  name of the package.
