The reference BLAS sources are part of the netlib LAPACK distribution.
They goes way back in R and were moved to this directory in 2006.  The
netlib sources had been commented and extensively re-formatted since.

Various double and complex routines were patched in 2006 in c53001.
Routine ZHER2K was patched in 2013 in c62981.
In all cases to avoid optimizations which set x*0 = 0 even if x was Inf or NaN.
This patching was redone in 2022.

comples*16 was changed to double complex, as that is what is used in R.

In LAPACK 3.10.0 dnrm2 and drotg were re-written in F90 using min/maxexponent,
so blas2.f90 contains those routines.
